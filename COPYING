COPYING POLICY AND OTHER LEGAL ISSUES

As far as I am concerned, the code I have written for this software
can be used freely for any purpose.  Any derived versions of this
software must be clearly marked as such, and if the derived work is
incompatible with the protocol description in the RFC file, it must be
called by a name other than "ssh" or "Secure Shell".

However, I am not implying to give any licenses to any patents or
copyrights held by third parties, and the software includes parts that
are not under my direct control.  As far as I know, all included
source code is used in accordance with the relevant license agreements
and can be used freely for any purpose (the GNU license being the most
restrictive); see below for details.

The RSA algorithm and even the concept of public key encryption are
claimed to patented in the United States.  These patents may interfere
with your right to use this software.  It is possible to compile the
software using the RSAREF2 library by giving --with-rsaref on the
configure command line.  This may or may not make it legal to use this
software for non-commercial purposes in the United States (I have sent
a query about this to RSADSI (on July 10, 1995), but have not received
an answer yet).  The RSAREF2 distribution is not included in this
distribution, but can be obtained from almost any ftp site worldwide
containing cryptographic materials.  Using RSAREF is not recommended
outside the United States.  See "http://www.cs.hut.fi/crypto" if you
have trouble finding the RSAREF library.

The 32-bit CRC compensation attack detector in deattack.c was
contributed by CORE SDI S.A. under a BSD-style license. See
http://www.core-sdi.com/english/ssh/ for details.

Some files, such as memmove.c and random.c, are owned by the Regents
of the University of California, and can be freely used and
distributed.  License terms are included in the affected files.  The
file scp.c is derived from code owned by the Regents of the University
of California, and can be used freely.

The MD5 implementation in md5.c was taken from PGP and is due to Colin
Plumb.  Comments in the file indicate that it is in the public domain.

The 32-bit CRC implementation in crc32.c is due to Gary S. Brown.
Comments in the file indicate it may be used for any purpose without
restrictions.

Note that any information and cryptographic algorithms used in this
software are publicly available on the Internet and at any major
bookstore, scientific library, and patent office worldwide.  More
information can be found e.g. at "http://www.cs.hut.fi/crypto".

The legal status of this program is some combination of all these
permissions and restrictions.  Use only at your own responsibility.
You will be responsible for any legal consequences yourself; I am not
making any claims whether possessing or using this is legal or not in
your country, and I am not taking any responsibility on your behalf.
