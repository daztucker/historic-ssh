COPYING POLICY AND OTHER LEGAL ISSUES

As far as I am concerned, the code I have written for this software
can be used freely as long as it is not sold for profit without my
permission.  This means, if you want to sell this software, or want to
include it in a commercial product, contact me.  Putting this software
on CD-ROM distributions containing other free software where a small
fee is asked for the CD but not for the programs is permitted.  

Any derived versions of this software must be clearly marked as such,
and must be called by a name other than "ssh".

I am not implying to give any licenses to any patents or copyrights
held by third parties, and the software includes parts that are not
under my direct control.  As far as I know, all included source code
is used in accordance with the relevant license agreements; see below
for details.

The RSA algorithm and even the concept of public key encryption are
claimed to patented in the United States.  These patents may interfere
with your right to use this software.  It is possible to compile the
software using the RSAREF2 library by giving --with-rsaref on the
configure command line.  This may or may not make it legal to use this
software for non-commercial purposes in the United States (I have sent
a query about this to RSADSI, but so far have received no response).
The RSAREF2 distribution is not included in this distribution, but can
be obtained from almost any ftp site worldwide containing
cryptographic materials.  Using RSAREF is not recommended outside the
United States.

The IDEA algorithm is patented in the United States and several other
countries.  PGP documentation and Schneier's Applied Cryptography
claim that it can be used freely for non-commercial purposes.  I have
sent a query about this to Ascom-Tech (the patent owner), but so far
have received no response.

The DES implementation in this distribution is derived from the libdes
library by Eric Young <eay@mincom.oz.au>.  It can be used under the
Gnu General Public License (libdes-COPYING) or the Artistic License
(libdes-ARTISTIC), at your option.  See libdes-README for more
information.  Eric Young has kindly given permission to distribute
the derived version under these terms.

The GNU Multiple Precision Library, included in this release and
linked into the executable, is distributed under the GNU General
Public License.  A copy can be found in gmp-1.3.2/COPYING.

The make-ssh-known-hosts script is distributed under the GNU General
Public License.  A copy can be found in gnu-COPYING-GPL.

Some files, such as memmove.c and random.c, are owned by the Regents
of the University of California, but can be freely used and
distributed.  License terms are included in the affected files.  The
file scp.c is derived from code owned by the Regents of the University
of California.

The TSS encryption algorithm implementation in tss.c is copyright Timo
Rinne and Cirion Oy.  It is used with permission, and permission has
been given for anyone to use it for any purpose as part of ssh.

The MD5 implementation in md5.c was taken from PGP and is due to Colin
Plumb.  Comments in the file indicate that it is in the public domain.

The 32-bit CRC implementation in crc32.c is due to Gary S. Brown.
Comments in the file indicate it may be used as desired without
restriction.


In some countries, particularly France, Russia, and Iraq, it may be
illegal to use any encryption at all without a special permit, and the
rumor has it that you cannot get a permit for any strong encryption.

This software may be freely imported into the United States; however,
once it is imported to the United States, it must not be re-exported.
I have no objections to re-exporting it, but the US government may
have.  I have been told that you become an international arms dealer
the moment you transfer cryptographic software out of the United
States, and "the federal mandatory sentencing guidelines for this
offence are 41 to 51 months in federal prison".  The rumor has it that
putting the software available on an ftp site in the USA might be
considered the same as exporting it.  Some say that it is legal to put
it for ftp as long as you only allow US hosts to retrieve it.  Contact
the Office of Defence Trade Controls if you need more information.
Also, please write to your congress and senate representatives to get
these silly and unconstitutional restrictions dropped.

Note that any information and cryptographic algorithms used in this
software are publicly available on the Internet and at any major
bookstore, scientific library, and patent office worldwide.

The legal status of this program is some combination of all these
permissions and restrictions.  Use only at your own responsibility.
You will be responsible for any legal consequences yourself; I am not
making any claims whether possessing or using this is legal or not in
your country, and I am not taking any responsibility on your behalf.
