Thu Sep 21 00:07:56 1995  Tatu Ylonen  <ylo@shadows.cs.hut.fi>

	* Added IgnoreRhosts server option.

	* Added USE_STRLEN_FOR_AF_UNIX; it is needed at least on MachTen.

Wed Sep 20 02:41:02 1995  Tatu Ylonen  <ylo@shadows.cs.hut.fi>

	* sshd.c (do_child): don't call packet_close when /etc/nologin,
	  because packet_close does shutdown, and the message does not get
	  sent.

	* pty.c (pty_allocate): Push ttcompat streams module.

	* randoms.c (random_acquire_light_environmental_noise): Don't use
	  the second argument to gettimeofday as it is not supported on
	  all systems.

	* login.c (record_login): Added NULL second argument to gettimeofday.

Tue Sep 19 13:25:48 1995  Tatu Ylonen  <ylo@shadows.cs.hut.fi>

	* fixed pclose wait() in sshd key regeneration (now only collects
	  easily available noise).

	* configure.in: test for bsdi before bsd*.

	* ssh.c: Don't print "Connection closed" if -q.

Wed Sep 13 04:19:52 1995  Tatu Ylonen  <ylo@shadows.cs.hut.fi>

	* Released ssh-1.2.5.

	* Hopefully fixed "Waiting for forwarded connections to terminate"
	  message.

	* randoms.c, md5.c: Large modifications to make these work on Cray
	  (which has no 32 bit integer type).

	* Fixed a problem with forwarded connection closes not being
	  reported immediately.

	* ssh.c: fixed rhosts authentication (broken by uid-swapping).

	* scp.c: Don't use -l if server user not specified (it made
	  setting User in the configuration file not work).

	* configure.in: don't use -pipe on BSDI.

	* randoms.c: Major modifications to make it work without 32 bit
	  integers (e.g. Cray).

	* md5.c: Major modifications to make it work without 32 bit
	  integers (e.g. Cray).

	* Eliminated HPSUX_BROKEN_PTYS.  The code is now enabled by 
	  default on all systems.

Mon Sep 11 00:53:12 1995  Tatu Ylonen  <ylo@shadows.cs.hut.fi>

	* sshd.c: don't include sshd pathname in log messages.

	* Added libwrap stuff (includes support for identd).

	* Added OSF/1 C2 extended security stuff.

	* Fixed interactions between getuid() and uid-swap stuff.

Sun Sep 10 00:29:27 1995  Tatu Ylonen  <ylo@shadows.cs.hut.fi>

	* serverloop.c: Don't send stdout data to client until after a few
	  milliseconds if there is very little data.  This is because some
	  systems give data from pty one character at a time, which would
	  multiply data size by about 16.

	* serverloop.c: Moved server do_session to a separate file and
	  renamed it server_loop.  Split it into several functions and
	  partially rewrote it.  Fixed "cat /etc/termcap | ssh foo cat" hangup.

	* Screwed up something while checking stuff in under cvs.  No harm,
	  but bogus log entries...

Sat Sep  9 02:24:51 1995  Tatu Ylonen  <ylo@shadows.cs.hut.fi>

	* minfd.c (_get_permanent_fd): Use SHELL environment variable.

	* channels.c (x11_create_display_inet): Created
	  HPSUX_NONSTANDARD_X11_KLUDGE; it causes DISPLAY to contain the
	  IP address of the host instead of the name, because HPSUX uses
	  some magic shared memory communication for local connections.

	* Changed SIGHUP processing in server; it should now work multiple
	  times.

	* Added length limits in many debug/log/error/fatal calls just in
 	  case.

	* login.c (get_last_login_time): Fixed location of lastlog.

	* Rewrote all uid-swapping code.  New files uidswap.h, uidswap.c.

	* Fixed several security problems involving chmod and chgrp (race
	  conditions).  Added warnings about dubious modes for /tmp/.X11-unix.

Fri Sep  8 20:03:36 1995  Tatu Ylonen  <ylo@shadows.cs.hut.fi>

	* Changed readconf.c to never display anything from the config
	  file.  This should now be prevented otherwise, but let's play safe.

	* log-server.c: Use %.500s in syslog() just to be sure (they
	  should already be shorter than 1024 though).

	* sshd.c: Moved setuid in child a little earlier (just to be
	  conservative, there was no security problem that I could detect).

	* README, INSTALL: Added info about mailing list and WWW page.

	* sshd.c: Added code to use SIGCHLD and wait zombies immediately.

	* Merged patch to set ut_addr in utmp.

	* Created ChangeLog and added it to Makefile.in.

	* Use read_passphrase instead of getpass().

	* Added SSH_FALLBACK_CIPHER.  Fixed a bug in default cipher
 	  selection (IDEA used to be selected even if not supported by the
 	  server).

	* Use no encryption for key files if empty passphrase.

	* Added section about --without-idea in INSTALL.

	* Version 1.2.0 was released a couple of days ago.
