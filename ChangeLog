Sun Oct  1 04:16:07 1995  Tatu Ylonen  <ylo@shadows.cs.hut.fi>

	* configure.in: When checking that the compiler works, check that
	  it understands ANSI C prototypes.

	* Made uidswap error message a debug() to avoid confusing errors
	  on AIX (AIX geteuid is brain-damaged and fails even for root).

	* Fixed an error in sshd.8 (FacistLogging -> FascistLogging).

	* Fixed distribution in Makefile.in (missing manual page .in files).

Sat Sep 30 17:38:46 1995  Tatu Ylonen  <ylo@shadows.cs.hut.fi>

	* auth-rhosts.c: Fixed serious security problem in
	  /etc/hosts.equiv authentication.

Fri Sep 29 00:41:02 1995  Tatu Ylonen  <ylo@shadows.cs.hut.fi>

	* Include machine/endian.h on Paragon.

	* ssh-add.c (add_file): Made ssh-add keep asking for the
	  passphrase until the user just types return or cancels.
	  Make the dialog display the comment of the key.

	* Read use shosts.equiv in addition to /etc/hosts.equiv.

	* sshd.8 is now sshd.8.in and is processed by configure to
	  substitute the proper paths for various files.  Ditto for ssh.1.
	  Ditto for make-ssh-known-hosts.1.
	
	* configure.in: Moved /etc/sshd_pid to PIDDIR/sshd.pid.  PIDDIR
	  will be /var/run if it exists, and ETCDIR otherwise.

Thu Sep 28 21:52:42 1995  Tatu Ylonen  <ylo@shadows.cs.hut.fi>

	* On Ultrix, check if sys/syslog.h needs to be included in
	  addition to syslog.h.

	* make-ssh-known-hosts.pl: Merged Kivinen's fixes for HPUX.

	* configure.in: Put -lwrap, -lsocks, etc. at the head of LIBS.

	* Fixed case-insensitivity in auth-rhosts.c.

	* Added missing socketpair.c to EXTRA_SRCS (needed on SCO), plus
	  other SCO fixes.

	* Makefile.in: Fixed missing install_prefixes.

Wed Sep 27 03:57:00 1995  Tatu Ylonen  <ylo@shadows.cs.hut.fi>

	* ssh-1.2.9.

	* Added SOCKS support.

	* Fixed default setting of IgnoreRhosts option.

	* Pass the magic cookie to xauth in stdin instead of command line;
	  the command line is visible in ps.

	* Added processing $HOME/.ssh/rc and /etc/sshrc.

	* Added a section to sshd.8 on what happens at login time.

Tue Sep 26 01:27:40 1995  Tatu Ylonen  <ylo@shadows.cs.hut.fi>

	* Don't define speed_t on SunOS 4.1.1; it conflicts with system 
	  headers.

	* Added support for .hushlogin.

	* Added --with-etcdir.

	* Read $HOME/.environment after /etc/environment.

Mon Sep 25 03:26:06 1995  Tatu Ylonen  <ylo@shadows.cs.hut.fi>

	* Merged patches for SCO Unix (from Michael Henits).

Sun Sep 24 22:28:02 1995  Tatu Ylonen  <ylo@shadows.cs.hut.fi>

	* Added ssh option ConnectionAttempts.

Sat Sep 23 12:30:15 1995  Tatu Ylonen  <ylo@shadows.cs.hut.fi>

	* sshd.c: Don't print last login time and /etc/motd if a command
	  has been specified (with ssh -t host command).

	* Added support for passing the screen number in X11 forwarding.
	  It is implemented as a compatible protocol extension, signalled
	  by SSH_PROTOFLAG_SCREEN_NUMBER by the child.

	* clientloop.c: Fixed bugs in the order in which things were
	  processed.  This may solve problems with some data not getting
	  sent to the server as soon as possible (probably solves the TCP
	  forwarding delayed close problem).  Also, it looked like window
	  changes might not get transmitted as early as possible in some
	  cases.
	
	* clientloop.c: Changed to detect window size change that
	  happened while ssh was suspended.

	* ssh.c: Moved the do_session function (client main loop) to
	  clientloop.c.  Divided it into smaller functions.  General cleanup.

	* ssh-1.2.8

Fri Sep 22 22:07:46 1995  Tatu Ylonen  <ylo@shadows.cs.hut.fi>

	* sshconnect.c (ssh_login): Made ssh_login take the options
	  structure as argument, instead of the individual arguments.

	* auth-rhosts.c (check_rhosts_file): Added support for netgroups.
	
	* auth-rhosts.c (check_rhosts_file): Added support for negated 
	  entries.

Thu Sep 21 00:07:56 1995  Tatu Ylonen  <ylo@shadows.cs.hut.fi>

	* auth-rhosts.c: Restructured rhosts authentication code.
	  Hosts.equiv now has same format as .rhosts: user names are allowed.

	* Added support for the Intel Paragon.

	* sshd.c: Don't use X11 forwarding with spoofing if no xauth
	  program.  Changed configure.in to not define XAUTH_PATH if
	  there is no xauth program.

	* ssh-1.2.7

	* sshd.c: Rewrote the code to build the environment.  Now also reads
	  /etc/environment.

	* sshd.c: Fixed problems in libwrap code.  --with-libwrap now
	  takes optional library name/path.

	* ssh-1.2.6

	* Define USE_PIPES by default.

	* Added support for Univel Unixware and MachTen.
	
	* Added IgnoreRhosts server option.

	* Added USE_STRLEN_FOR_AF_UNIX; it is needed at least on MachTen.

Wed Sep 20 02:41:02 1995  Tatu Ylonen  <ylo@shadows.cs.hut.fi>

	* sshd.c (do_child): don't call packet_close when /etc/nologin,
	  because packet_close does shutdown, and the message does not get
	  sent.

	* pty.c (pty_allocate): Push ttcompat streams module.

	* randoms.c (random_acquire_light_environmental_noise): Don't use
	  the second argument to gettimeofday as it is not supported on
	  all systems.

	* login.c (record_login): Added NULL second argument to gettimeofday.

Tue Sep 19 13:25:48 1995  Tatu Ylonen  <ylo@shadows.cs.hut.fi>

	* fixed pclose wait() in sshd key regeneration (now only collects
	  easily available noise).

	* configure.in: test for bsdi before bsd*.

	* ssh.c: Don't print "Connection closed" if -q.

Wed Sep 13 04:19:52 1995  Tatu Ylonen  <ylo@shadows.cs.hut.fi>

	* Released ssh-1.2.5.

	* Hopefully fixed "Waiting for forwarded connections to terminate"
	  message.

	* randoms.c, md5.c: Large modifications to make these work on Cray
	  (which has no 32 bit integer type).

	* Fixed a problem with forwarded connection closes not being
	  reported immediately.

	* ssh.c: fixed rhosts authentication (broken by uid-swapping).

	* scp.c: Don't use -l if server user not specified (it made
	  setting User in the configuration file not work).

	* configure.in: don't use -pipe on BSDI.

	* randoms.c: Major modifications to make it work without 32 bit
	  integers (e.g. Cray).

	* md5.c: Major modifications to make it work without 32 bit
	  integers (e.g. Cray).

	* Eliminated HPSUX_BROKEN_PTYS.  The code is now enabled by 
	  default on all systems.

Mon Sep 11 00:53:12 1995  Tatu Ylonen  <ylo@shadows.cs.hut.fi>

	* sshd.c: don't include sshd pathname in log messages.

	* Added libwrap stuff (includes support for identd).

	* Added OSF/1 C2 extended security stuff.

	* Fixed interactions between getuid() and uid-swap stuff.

Sun Sep 10 00:29:27 1995  Tatu Ylonen  <ylo@shadows.cs.hut.fi>

	* serverloop.c: Don't send stdout data to client until after a few
	  milliseconds if there is very little data.  This is because some
	  systems give data from pty one character at a time, which would
	  multiply data size by about 16.

	* serverloop.c: Moved server do_session to a separate file and
	  renamed it server_loop.  Split it into several functions and
	  partially rewrote it.  Fixed "cat /etc/termcap | ssh foo cat" hangup.

	* Screwed up something while checking stuff in under cvs.  No harm,
	  but bogus log entries...

Sat Sep  9 02:24:51 1995  Tatu Ylonen  <ylo@shadows.cs.hut.fi>

	* minfd.c (_get_permanent_fd): Use SHELL environment variable.

	* channels.c (x11_create_display_inet): Created
	  HPSUX_NONSTANDARD_X11_KLUDGE; it causes DISPLAY to contain the
	  IP address of the host instead of the name, because HPSUX uses
	  some magic shared memory communication for local connections.

	* Changed SIGHUP processing in server; it should now work multiple
	  times.

	* Added length limits in many debug/log/error/fatal calls just in
 	  case.

	* login.c (get_last_login_time): Fixed location of lastlog.

	* Rewrote all uid-swapping code.  New files uidswap.h, uidswap.c.

	* Fixed several security problems involving chmod and chgrp (race
	  conditions).  Added warnings about dubious modes for /tmp/.X11-unix.

Fri Sep  8 20:03:36 1995  Tatu Ylonen  <ylo@shadows.cs.hut.fi>

	* Changed readconf.c to never display anything from the config
	  file.  This should now be prevented otherwise, but let's play safe.

	* log-server.c: Use %.500s in syslog() just to be sure (they
	  should already be shorter than 1024 though).

	* sshd.c: Moved setuid in child a little earlier (just to be
	  conservative, there was no security problem that I could detect).

	* README, INSTALL: Added info about mailing list and WWW page.

	* sshd.c: Added code to use SIGCHLD and wait zombies immediately.

	* Merged patch to set ut_addr in utmp.

	* Created ChangeLog and added it to Makefile.in.

	* Use read_passphrase instead of getpass().

	* Added SSH_FALLBACK_CIPHER.  Fixed a bug in default cipher
 	  selection (IDEA used to be selected even if not supported by the
 	  server).

	* Use no encryption for key files if empty passphrase.

	* Added section about --without-idea in INSTALL.

	* Version 1.2.0 was released a couple of days ago.
