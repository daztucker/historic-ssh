Merge rdist into the ssh distribution.
  - patch for stdin/stdout
  - -P arguments
  - configure/makefile

mcooper@usc.edu says `tty` returns 'not a tty' when run from
/etc/sshrc after 'ssh $host' where the server is a sunos 4.1.3 host.

Check TIS FWTK/authsrv (and FWTK authentication in general).  Message
from rsnyder@mobster.cit.ge.com.  ftp://ftp.tis.com/pub/firewalls/toolkit.

Update protocol to send information about the accepted authentication
methods for the particular user after the user has been identified.

Update protocol to send real client host name.  Add server
configuration options to specify firewall names, and disable Rhosts
authentication and trust the supplied name (with RSA, of course) if
the connection appears to be coming from the firewall.

Update protocol to include session id to both sides of session key.
Change all encryption methods to use different keys for each direction.

Update protocol to use stronger MACs.

Extend protocol to easily permit ip-forwarding only servers without
authentication.

Update protocol to negotiate 16-bit packet size fields and string size fields.

Update protocol to negotiate maximum packet size (before 1.3.0!)

Some kind of access control for forwarded sockets (e.g., localhost only).

OSF/1 C2 extended security improvements (hl@tekla.fi)

scp sometimes gives Z_DATA_ERROR in inflate (alpha?).  (bortzmeyer@pasteur.fr)

Check X11 authentication sometimes fails (particularly on HPUX).

npasswd-style checking for passphrases. mcduff@physics.uq.oz.au.

Merge pid file patches from duvall@dhduvall.student.princeton.edu.

Check whether Kocher's timing attack is applicable to ssh.
Should ssh sleep a random time after each RSA computation?

Add escape ~% to print out compression statistics.  Also, show
information about encryption status.

Host key fingerprints (ssh-keygen, shown when mismatch or new).

When automatically adding host name, add all names.

Add "tags" target in Makefile.in.

Document sshd SIGHUP.

Recommend that .shosts, authorized_keys, known_hosts not world-readable.

Read /etc/ssh_random_seed also in ssh client.  (In addition to user's own).

Consider using snprintf instead of sprintf.

Change -f to fork only after forwardings are in effect.

Update copyrights.

Rename rc4 -> rcfour to avoid potential trademark problems.
