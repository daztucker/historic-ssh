merge netgroup patches

identd shows remote user as root (uidswap problem?)

Rewrite client main loop.

Make ssh_login take the client option structure instead of individual fields.

sunos 4.1.3, cray: scp: ssh hangs at sending end, sshd, tcsh, scp hang at
receiving end

Screen number is not passed in X11 forwarding.

Server option to prevent login if client host is not found from known_hosts.

Compression before encryption (optional).

Add host name to "Waiting for forwarded connections to terminate" message.

Permit user names in /etc/hosts.equiv.

Should check for changed window size after coming back to foreground.

Replace PermitRootLogin by PermitRootLoginFrom

Could probably safely forward INET X11 connection in every case, as we
now check the fake cookie in the client.

socks support?  (Or some other form of firewall traversing support)
  - problems, socks does not seem to support getpeername
