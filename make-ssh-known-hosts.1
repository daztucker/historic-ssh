.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The
.B make-ssh-known-hosts.pl
is a
.B perl
version 5 script that creates the
.B /etc/ssh_known_hosts
file that contains the public keys of known hosts. 
That file is used by
.B sshd\c
\|, and if the client's hostname is not found from
.B /etc/ssh_known_hosts
.B sshd
disables
.B .rhosts
authentication. The
.B /etc/ssh_known_hosts
is also used to check that the public key returned by the remote host
matches the one stored in the local
.B /etc/ssh_known_hosts
file (to prevent man-in-the-middle attacs).

.LP
The
.B make-ssh-known-hosts.pl
program finds all the hosts in the domain by making a DNS query to the
master domain name server of the domain. The master domain name server
is located by searching the SOA record of the domain from the initial
domain name server (which can be specified with the
.B \-\-initialdns
option). The master domain name server can also be given directly with
.B \-\-server
option.
After getting the hostname list
.B make-ssh-known-hosts.pl
tries to get the public key from every host in the domain. It first
uses
.B ping
to check that the host is alive, and if it is alive it tries to run
the command
.B cat /etc/ssh_host_key.pub
in the remote machine with
.B ssh\c
\|. If the command succeeds, it knows the remote machine has
.B ssh
installed properly and prints the 
.B /etc/ssh_known_hosts
entry to the
.B STDOUT\c
\|.

.LP
If the command fails it checks if the
.B ssh
client got the public key from the remote host in the initial dialog,
and if so, it will print a proper entry, but comment it out (unless the
.B \-\-trustdaemon
option is given).

.LP
.I Domain_name
is the domain name that is searched.
.B Take_regexp
is a perl regular expression that matches the host to be taken from the
domain. The data matched contains all the DNS records in the form "\|\c
.B fieldname=value\c
\|". The fields are separated with newline, and the perl match is made in
multiline mode and it is case insensetive. The multiline mode means
that you can use a regexp like "\|\c
.B ^wks=*telnet.*$\c
\|" to match all hosts that have WKS (well known services) field that
contain value "telnet".
.B Remove_regexp
is similar but those hosts are not added that match that regexp
(use it to filter out PCs and Macs with hinfo field: "\|\c
.B ^hinfo=.*(mac|pc)\c
\|").

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI "\-\-initialdns " "initial_dns"\c
.TP
.BI "\-i " "initial_dns"\c
\&Set the initial domain name server used to query the SOA record of the
domain.

.TP
.BI "\-\-server " "domain_name_server"\c
.TP
.BI "\-se " "domain_name_server"\c
\&Set the master domain name server of the domain. This host is used
to query the DNS list of the domain.

.TP
.BI "\-\-subdomains " "subdomainlist"\c
.TP
.BI "\-su " "subdomainlist"\c
\&Comma separated list of subdomains that are added to hostnames. For
example, if subdomainlist is "\|\c
.I ,foo, foo.bar, foo.bar.zappa, foo.bar.zappa.hut.fi\c
\|" then when host foobar is added to
.B /etc/ssh_known_hosts
file it has aliases "\|\c
.I foobar, foobar.foo, foobar.foo.bar, foobar.foo.bar.zappa, foobar.foo.bar.zappa.hut.fi\c
\|". The default action is to take all subparts of the host but the
second last host by host basis.

.TP
.BI "\-\-debug " "debug_level"\c
.TP
.BI "\-de " "debug_level"\c
\&Set the debug level. Default is 5, bigger values give more output.
Using big value (like 999) will print lots of debugging output.

.TP
.BI "\-\-timeout " "exec_timeout"\c
.TP
.BI "\-ti " "exec_timeout"\c
\&Timeout when executing
.B ping
or
.B ssh
commands. Default is 60 seconds.

.TP
.BI "\-\-passwordtimeout " "timeout_when_asking_password"\c
.TP
.BI "\-pa " "timeout_when_asking_password"\c
\&Timeout when asking password for ssh command. Default is 600
seconds, use value 0 to timeout password queries immediately. 

.TP
.BI "\-\-trustdaemon"\c
.TP
.BI "\-tr"\c
\&If the
.B ssh
command fails, use the public key stored in the
.B $HOME/.ssh/known_hosts
file and trust it is the correct key for the host. If this option is not
given such entries are commented out in the generated
.B /etc/ssh_known_hosts
file.

.TP
.BI "\-\-domainnamesplit"\c
.TP
.BI "\-do"\c
\&Split the domainname to get the list of subdomains. Use this option
if you don't want hostname to splitted to pieces automatically.
Default splitting is done host by host basis. If the domain is
zappa.hut.fi, and the host name is foo.bar then default action adds
entries "\|\c
.I foo, foo.bar, foo.bar.zappa, foo.bar.zappa.hut.fi\c
\|" and this options adds entries "\|\c
.I foo.bar, foo.bar.zappa, foo.bar.zappa.hut.fi\c
\|").

.TP
.BI "\-\-silent"\c
.TP
.BI "\-si"\c
\&Be silent.

.TP
.BI "\-\-nslookup " "path_to_nslookup_program"\c
.TP
.BI "\-n " "path_to_nslookup_program"\c
\&Path to the
.B nslookup
program. 

.TP
.BI "\-\-ping " "path_to_ping_program"\c
.TP
.BI "\-pi " "path_to_ping_program"\c
\&Path to the
.B ping
program. The full command line is: "\|\c
.B ping preoptions hostname postoptions\c
\|".

.TP
.BI "\-\-pingpreoptions " "options_before_hostname"\c
.TP
.BI "\-pingpr " "options_before_hostname"\c
\&Options given to
.B ping
program before hostname.

.TP
.BI "\-\-pingpostoptions " "options_after_hostname"\c
.TP
.BI "\-pingpo " "options_after_hostname"\c
\&Options given to
.B ping
program after hostname.

.TP
.BI "\-\-ssh " "path_to_ssh_program"\c
.TP
.BI "\-ss " "path_to_ssh_program"\c
\&Path to the
.B ssh
program.

.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
The following command:
.IP
.B example# perl5 make-ssh-known-hosts.pl cs.hut.fi > \c
.B /etc/ssh_known_hosts
.LP
finds all public keys of the hosts in
.B cs.hut.fi
domain and put them to
.B /etc/ssh_known_hosts
file splitting domain names on a per host basis.
.LP
The command (if your perl5 is in /usr/local/bin):
.IP
.B example% ./make-ssh-known-hosts hut.fi '^wks=.*ssh' > \c
.B hut-hosts
.LP
finds all hosts in
.B hut.fi
domain that have ssh service and puts their public key to hut-hosts
file. This would require that the domain name server of hut.fi would
define all hosts running ssh to have entry ssh in their WKS record.
Because nobody yet adds ssh to WKS, it would be better to use command
.IP
.B example% ./make-ssh-known-hosts hut.fi '^wks=.*telnet' > \c
.B hut-hosts
.LP
that would take those host having telnet service. This uses default
subdomain list.

.LP
The command:
.IP
.B example% ./make-ssh-known-hosts hut.fi 'dipoli.hut.fi' '^hinfo=.*(mac|pc)' > \c
.B dipoli-hosts
.LP
finds all hosts in hut.fi domain that are in dipoli.hut.fi subdomain
and that are not Mac or PC.
