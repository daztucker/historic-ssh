.SH DESCRIPTION 
.LP
.B Scp
copies files between hosts on a network.  It uses
.B ssh
for data transfer, and uses the same authentication and provides the
same security as
.B ssh.
Unlike
.BR rcp ",
.B scp
will ask for passwords or passphrases if they are needed for
authentication.
.LP
Any file name may contain a host and user specification to indicate
that the file is to be copied to/from that host.  Copies between two
remote hosts are permitted.

.SH OPTIONS

.TP 0.6i
.B \-a
Turn on statistics display for each file.
.TP
.B \-A
Turn off statistics display for each file.
.TP
.BI \-c "\ cipher
Selects the cipher to use for encrypting the data transfer.  This
option is directly passed to
.B ssh.
.TP
.BI \-i "\ identity_file
Selects the file from which the identity (private key) for RSA
authentication is read.  This option is directly passed to
.B ssh.
.TP
.B \-L
Use non privileged port. With this you cannot use
rhosts  or rsarhosts authentications, but it can be
used to bypass some firewalls that dont allow privileged
source ports to pass. Same as saying "-o UsePriviledgePort=no"
or -P to ssh; -L is used due to exhaustion of suitable letters.
.TP
.B \-1
Force scp to use command "scp1" on the remote side instead of "scp".
This may be necessary in some situations, if the remote system has
"scp2" symlinked to "scp".
.TP
.BI \-o "\ ssh-options
Ssh options passed to ssh.
.TP
.B \-p
Preserves modification times, access times, and modes from the
original file.
.TP
.B \-q
Turn off statistics display.
.TP
.B \-Q
Turn on statistics display.
.TP
.B \-r
Recursively copy entire directories.
.TP
.B \-v
Verbose mode.  Causes
.B scp
and 
.B ssh
to print debugging messages about their progress.  This is helpful in
debugging connection, authentication, and configuration problems.
.TP
.B \-B
Selects batch mode (prevents asking for passwords or passphrases).
.TP
.B \-C
Compression enable.  Passes the -C flag to
.B ssh
to enable compression.
.TP
.BI \-P "\ port
Specifies the port to connect to on the remote host.  Note that this
option is written with a capital P, because \-p is already reserved for
preserving the times and modes of the file in rcp.
.TP
.BI \-S "\ path-to-ssh
Specifies the path to ssh program.

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.LP
You can turn scp statistics on or off by setting
.B SSH_SCP_STATS
or
.B SSH_NO_SCP_STATS
environment variables. To turn on or off scp statistics for each file,
use 
.B SSH_ALL_SCP_STATS
or
.B SSH_NO_ALL_SCP_STATS
environment variables. The default value of the statistics can be set
when the ssh is configured. Next the scp checks those environment
variables and after that command line options.
