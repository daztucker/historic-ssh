.SH NAME
.B scp
\- secure copy (remote file copy program)

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B scp
[-p]
[-r]
[-v]
[-c cipher]
[-i identity]
[[user@]host:]filename1 [[user@]host:]filename2

.B scp
[-p] [-r] [-v] [-c cipher] [-i identity]
[[user@]host:]filename... [[user@]host:]directory

.SH DESCRIPTION 
.B Scp
copies files between hosts on a network.  It uses
.B ssh
for data transfer, and uses the same authentication and provides the
same security as
.B ssh.
Unlike
.B rcp,
.B ssh
will ask for passwords or passphrases if they are needed for
authentication.

Any file name may contain a host and user specification to indicate
that the file is to be copied to/from that host.  Copies between two
remote hosts are permitted.

.SH OPTIONS

.B -c cipher
Selects the cipher to use for encrypting the data transfer.  This
option is directly passed to
.B ssh.

.B -i identity_file
Selects the file from which the identity (private key) for RSA
authentication is read.  This option is directly passed to
.B ssh.

.B -p
Preserves modification times, access times, and modes from the
original file.

.B -r
Recursively copy entire directories.

.B -v
Verbose mode.  Causes
.B scp
and 
.B ssh
to print debugging messages about its progress.  This is helpful in
debugging connection, authentication, and configuration problems.

.SH AUTHOR

.B Scp
is based on the
.B rcp
program in BSD source code from the Regents of the University of
California.
