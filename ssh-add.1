.SH NAME
ssh-add \- adds identities for the authentication agent

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ssh-add

.B \-p\c
]
[\c
.B \-l\c
]
[\c
.B \-d\c
]
[\c

.SH DESCRIPTION 
.LP
.B Ssh-add
adds identities to the authentication agent,
.B ssh-agent.
When run without arguments, it adds the file
.IR $HOME/\s+2.\s0ssh/identity ".
Alternative file names can be given on the
command line.  If any file requires a passphrase,
.B ssh-add
asks for the passphrase from the user.  If the -p option is given then
the passphrase is read from stdin, otherwise if the user is using X11,
the passphrase is requested using a small X11 program; otherwise it is
read from the user's tty.  (Note: it may be necessary to redirect stdin
from /dev/null to get the passphrase requested using X11.)
.LP
The authentication agent must be running and must be an ancestor of
the current process for
.B ssh-add
to work.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP 0.5i
.B \-p
Read passphrase from stdin (or pipe).
.TP
.B \-l
Lists all identities currently represented by the agent.
.TP
.B \-d
Instead of adding the identity, removes the identity from the agent.
.TP
.B \-D
Deletes all identities from the agent.

.SH RETURN STATUS

.B Ssh-add
returns one of the following exit statuses.  These may be useful in scripts.
.IP 0
The requested operation was performed successfully.
.IP 1
No connection could be made to the authentication agent.  Presumably
there is no authentication agent active in the execution environment
of
.B ssh-add.
.IP 2
The user did not supply a required passphrase.
.IP 3
An identify file could not be found, was not readable, or was in
bad format.
.IP 4
The agent does not have the requested identity.
.IP 5
An unspecified error has occurred; this is a catch-all for errors not
listed above.
.RT

.SH FILES
.TP 
.I \&$HOME/\s+2.\s0ssh/identity
Contains the RSA authentication identity of the user.  This file
should not be readable by anyone but the user.  It is possible to
specify a passphrase when generating the key; that passphrase will be
used to encrypt the private part of this file.  This is the
default file added by
.B ssh-add
when no other files have been specified.
.IP
If
.B ssh-add
needs a passphrase, it will read the passphrase from the current
terminal if it was run from a terminal.  If
.B ssh-add
does not have a terminal associated with it but
.SM DISPLAY\s0
is set, it
will open an X11 window to read the passphrase.  This is particularly
useful when calling
.B ssh-add
from a .Xsession or related script.  (Note that on some machines it
may be necessary to redirect the input from /dev/null to make this work.)
