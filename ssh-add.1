.SH NAME
ssh-add \- adds identities for the authentication agent

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ssh-add [-l] [-d] [files]

.SH DESCRIPTION 
.B Ssh-add adds identities to the authentication agent,
.B ssh-agent.
When run without arguments, it adds the file
\f4$HOME/.ssh/identity\f1.  Alternative file names can be given on the
command line.  If any file has a passphrase,
.B ssh-add
asks for the passphrase from the user.  If the user is using X11, the
passphrase is requested using a small X11 program; otherwise it is
read from the user's tty.

The authentication agent must be running and must be an ancestor of
the current process for
.B ssh-agent
to work.

All identities currently represented by the agent can be listed by
giving the
.B -l
option.

.SH OPTIONS
.B -l
Lists all identities currently represented by the agent.

.B -d
Instead of adding the identity, removes the identity from the agent.

.SH FILES
\f4\&$HOME/.ssh/identity\f1
Contains the RSA authentication identity of the user.  This file
should not be readable by anyone but the user.  It is possible to
specify a passphrase when generating the key; that passphrase will be
used to encrypt the private part of this file using IDEA.  This is the
default file added by
.B ssh-add
when no other files have been specified.
