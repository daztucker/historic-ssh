.SH NAME
ssh-keygen \- authentication key generation

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ssh-keygen
[-b bits]

.B ssh-keygen -p

.B ssh-keygen -c

.SH DESCRIPTION 
.B Ssh-keygen
generates and manages authentication keys for 
.B ssh(1).
Normally each user wishing to use
.B ssh
with RSA authentication runs this once to create the authentication
key in \f4$HOME/.ssh/identity\f1.  Additionally, the system
administrator may use this to generate host keys.

Normally this program generates the key and asks for a file in which
to store the private key.  The public key is stored in a file with the
same name with ".pub" appended.  The program also asks for a
passphrase.  The passphrase may be empty to indicate no passphrase
(host keys must have empty passphrase), or it may be a string of
arbitrary length.  Good passphrases are 10-30 characters long and are
not simple sentences or otherwise easily guessable (English
prose has only 1-2 bits of entropy per word, and provides very bad
passphrases).  There is no way to recover a lost passphrase (you will
have to generate a new key and copy the corresponding public key to
other machines).

.B Ssh-keygen
can also be used to change the passphrase of a private key file.  To
do this, use the
.B -p
option.

There is also a comment field in the key file that is only for
convenience to the user to help identify the key.  The comment can
tell what the key is for, or whatever is useful.  The comment is
initialized to user@host when the key is created, but can be changed
using the
.B -c
option.

.SH OPTIONS
.B -b bits
Specifies the number of bits in the key to create.  Minimum is 512
bits.  Generally 1024 bits is considered sufficient, and key sizes
above that no longer improve security but make things slower.  The
default is 1024 bits.

.B -p
Requests changing the passphrase of a private key file instead of
creating a new private key.  The program will prompt for the file
containing the private key, for the old passphrase, and twice for the
new passphrase.

.B -c
Requests changing the comment in the private and public key files.
The program will prompt for the file containing the private keys, for
passphrase if the key has one, and for the new comment.

.SH FILES
\f4\&$HOME/.ssh/random_seed\f1
Used for seeding the random number generator.  This file should not be
readable by anyone but the user.  This file is created the first time
the program is run.
.P
\f4\&$HOME/.ssh/identity\f1
Contains the RSA authentication identity of the user.  This file
should not be readable by anyone but the user.  It is possible to
specify a passphrase when generating the key; that passphrase will be
used to encrypt the private part of this file using IDEA.  This file
is not automatically accessed by
.B ssh-keygen,
but it is offered as the default file for the private key.
.P
\f4\&$HOME/.ssh/identity.pub\f1
Contains the public key for authentication.  The contents of this file
should be added to \f4$HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys\f1 on all machines
where you wish to log in using RSA authnetication.  There is no
need to keep the contents of this file secret.
