.SH DESCRIPTION 
.LP
.B Ssh
(Secure Shell) a program for logging into a remote machine and for
executing commands in a remote machine.  It is intended to replace
rlogin and rsh, and provide secure encrypted communications between
two untrusted hosts over an insecure network.  X11 connections and
arbitrary TCP/IP ports can also be forwarded over the secure channel.
.LP
.B Ssh 
connects and logs into the specified 
.IR hostname .  
The user must prove
his/her identity to the remote machine using one of several methods.
.LP
First, if the machine the user logs in from is listed in
.I /etc/hosts.equiv
on the remote machine, and the user names are
the same on both sides, the user is immediately permitted to log in.
Second, if 
.I \&\s+2.\s0rhosts
or
.I \&\s+2.\s0shosts
exists in the user's home directory on the
remote machine and contains a line containing the name of the client
machine and the name of the user on that machine, the user is
permitted to log in.  This form of authentication is normally not
allowed by the server because it is not secure.
.LP
The second (and primary) authentication method is the
.B rhosts
or
.B hosts.equiv
method combined with RSA-based host authentication.  It
means that if the login would be permitted by
.I \&\s+2.\s0rhosts\c
\|,
.I \&\s+2.\s0shosts
or
.IR /etc/hosts.equiv ",
and additionally it can verify the client's
host key (see 
.I \&$HOME/\s+2.\s0ssh/known_hosts
and
.I /etc/ssh_known_hosts
in the
.B \s-1FILES\s0
section), only then login is
permitted.  This authentication method closes security holes due to IP
spoofing, DNS spoofing and routing spoofing.  [Note to the
administrator:
.IR /etc/hosts.equiv ", 
.IR \&\s+2.\s0rhosts ",
and the rlogin/rsh protocol in general, are inherently insecure and should be
disabled if security is desired.]
.LP
As a third authentication method, 
.B ssh 
supports RSA based authentication.
The scheme is based on public-key cryptography: there are cryptosystems
where encryption and decryption are done using separate keys, and it
is not possible to derive the decryption key from the encryption key.
RSA is one such system.  The idea is that each user creates a public/private 
key pair for authentication purposes.  The
server knows the public key, and only the user knows the private key.
The file 
.I \&$HOME/\s+2.\s0ssh/authorized_keys
lists the public keys that are permitted for logging
in.  When the user logs in, the
.B ssh 
program tells the server which key pair it would like to use for
authentication.  The server checks if this key is permitted, and if
so, sends the user (actually the
.B ssh
program running on behalf of the user) a challenge, a random number,
encrypted by the user's public key.  The challenge can only be
decrypted using the proper private key.  The user's client then decrypts the
challenge using the private key, proving that he/she knows the private
key but without disclosing it to the server.
.LP
.B Ssh
implements the RSA authentication protocol automatically.  The user
creates his/her RSA key pair by running
.BR ssh-keygen (1).
This stores the private key in 
.I \&\s+2.\s0ssh/identity
and the public key in
.I \&\s+2.\s0ssh/identity.pub
in the user's home directory.  The user should then
copy the 
.I identity.pub
to 
.I \&\s+2.\s0ssh/authorized_keys
in his/her home directory on the remote machine (the 
.I authorized_keys
file corresponds to the conventional 
.I \&\s+2.\s0rhosts
file, and has one key
per line, though the lines can be very long).  After this, the user
can log in without giving the password.  RSA authentication is much
more secure than rhosts authentication.
.LP
The most convenient way to use RSA authentication may be with an
authentication agent.  See
.BR ssh-agent (1)
for more information.
.LP
If other authentication methods fail, 
.B ssh
prompts the user for a password.  The password is sent to the remote
host for checking; however, since all communications are encrypted,
the password cannot be seen by someone listening on the network.
.LP
When the user's identity has been accepted by the server, the server
either executes the given command, or logs into the machine and gives
the user a normal shell on the remote machine.  All communication with
the remote command or shell will be automatically encrypted.
.LP
If a pseudo-terminal has been allocated (normal login session), the
user can disconnect with "~.", and suspend
.B ssh
with "~^Z".  A single tilde character can be sent as "~~" (or by
following the tilde by a character other than those described above).
The escape character must always follow a newline to be interpreted as
special.  The escape character can be changed in configuration files
or on the command line.  If no pseudo tty has been allocated, the
session is transparent and can be used to reliably transfer binary
data.
.LP
The session terminates when the command or shell in on the remote
machine exists and all X11 and TCP/IP connections have been closed.
The exit status of the remote program is returned as the exit status
of
.B ssh.
.LP
If the user is using X11 (the
.B \s-1DISPLAY\s0
environment variable is set), the connection to the X11 display is
automatically forwarded to the remote side in such a way that any X11
programs started from the shell (or command) will go through the
encrypted channel, and the connection to the real X server will be made
from the local machine.  The user should not manually set
.BR \s-1DISPLAY\s0 ".
Forwarding of X11 connections can be
configured on the command line or in configuration files.
.LP
If the user is using an authentication agent, the connection to the agent
is automatically forwarded to the remote side unless disabled on
command line or in a configuration file.
.LP
Forwarding of arbitrary TCP/IP connections over the secure channel can
be specified either on command line or in a configuration file.  One
possible application of TCP/IP forwarding is a secure connection to an
electronic purse; another is going trough firewalls.
.LP
.B Ssh
automatically maintains and checks a database containing RSA-based
identifications for all hosts it has ever been used with.  The
database is stored in 
.I \&\s+2.\s0ssh/known_hosts
in the user's home directory.  Additionally, the file 
.I /etc/ssh_known_hosts
is automatically checked for known hosts.  Any new hosts are
automatically added to the user's file.  If a host's identification
ever changes,
.B ssh
warns about this and disables password authentication to prevent a
trojan horse from getting the user's password.  Another purpose of
this mechanism is to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks which could
otherwise be used to circumvent the encryption.


.ne 5
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-a
Disables forwarding of the authentication agent connection.  This may
also be specified on a per-host basis in the configuration file.
.ne 3
.TP
.BI \-c \ \fIidea\fR\||\|\fIdes\fR\||\|\fI3des\fR\||\|\fIrc4\fR\||\|\fItss\fR\||\|\fInone\fR
Selects the cipher to use for encrypting the session. 
.B \s-1IDEA\s0
is used by default.  It is believed to be secure. 
.B \s-1DES\s0
is the data encryption standard, but is breakable by major
governments, large corporations, and major criminal organizations.
.B \s-13DES\s0
(triple-des) is encrypt-decrypt-encrypt triple with three different
keys.  It is presumably more secure than
.BR \s-1DES\s0 ".
.B \s-1RC4\s0
is the (alleged)
.B \s-1RC4\s0
algorithm posted in the Usenet News in 1995 (\fB\s-1RC4\s0\fR was
originally a trade secret algorithm of RSA Data Security and has not
been published; however, this implementation is widely believed to be
equivalent).  This is the fastest algorithm currently supported.
.B \s-1TSS\s0
is a fast home-grown algorithm based on
.BR \s-1MD5\s0 ".
The algorithm may also be selected on a per-host basis in the
configuration file.
.ne 3
.TP
.B \-e \fIch\fR\||\|\fI^ch\fR\||\|\fInone\fR
Sets the escape character for sessions with a pty (default: ~).  The
escape character is only recognized at the beginning of a line.  The
escape character followed by a dot (.) closes the connection, followed
by control-Z suspends the connection, and followed by itself sends the
escape character once.  Setting the character to 'none' disables any
escapes and makes the session fully transparent.
.ne 3
.TP
.B \-f
Requests ssh to go to background after authentication.  This is useful
if ssh is going to ask for passwords or passphrases, but the user
wants it in the background.  This implies 
.B \-n.
.ne 3
.TP
.BI \-i \ identity_file
Selects the file from which the identity (private key) for 
.B \s-1RSA\s0
authentication is read.  Default is 
.I \&\s+2.\s0ssh/identity
in the user's home directory.  Identity files may also be specified on
a per-host basis in the configuration file.  It is possible to have
multiple \-i options (and multiple identities specified in
configuration files).
.ne 3
.TP
.BI -l \ login_name
Specifies the user to log in as on the remote machine.  This may also
be specified on a per-host basis in the configuration file.
.ne 3
.TP
.B \-n
Redirects stdin from /dev/null (actually, prevents reading from stdin).
This must be used when
.B ssh
is run in the background.  A common trick is to use this to run X11
programs in a remote machine.  For example, "ssh -n shadows.cs.hut.fi
emacs &" will start an emacs on shadows.cs.hut.fi, and the X11
connection will be automatically forwarded over an encrypted channel.
The
.B ssh
program will be put in the background.
.ne 3
.TP
.BI \-o "\ 'option'
Can be used to give options in the format used in the config file.
This is useful for specifying options for which there is no separate
command-line flag.  The option has the same format as a line in the
configuration file.
.ne 3
.TP
.BI \-p "\ port
Port to connect to on the remote host.  This can be specified on a
per-host basis in the configuration file.
.ne 3
.TP
.B \-q
Quiet mode.  Causes all warning and diagnostic messages to be
suppressed.  Only fatal errors are displayed.
.ne 3
.TP
.B \-t
Force pseudo-tty allocation.  This can be used to execute arbitary
screen-based programs on a remote machine, which can be very useful
e.g. when implementing menu services.
.ne 3
.TP
.B \-v
Verbose mode.  Causes
.B ssh
to print debugging messages about its progress.  This is helpful in
debugging connection, authentication, and configuration problems.
.ne 3
.TP
.B \-x
Disables X11 forwarding.  This can also be specified on a per-host
basis in a configuration file.
.ne 3
.TP
.BI \-L "\ port:host:hostport
Specifies that the given port on the local (client) host is to be
forwarded to the given host and port on the remote side.  This works
by allocating a socket to listen to
.B port
on the local side, and whenever a connection is made to this port, the
connection is forwarded over the secure channel, and a connection is
made to
.B host:hostport
from the remote machine.  Port forwardings can also be specified in the
configuration file.  Only root can forward privileged ports.
.ne 3
.TP
.BI \-R "\ port:host:hostport
Specifies that the given port on the remote (server) host is to be
forwarded to the given host and port on the local side.  This works
by allocating a socket to listen to
.B port
on the remote side, and whenever a connection is made to this port, the
connection is forwarded over the secure channel, and a connection is
made to
.B host:hostport
from the local machine.  Port forwardings can also be specified in the
configuration file.  Only root can forward privileged ports.

.SH CONFIGURATION FILES
.LP
.B Ssh
obtains configuration data from the following sources (in this order):
command line options, user's configuration file
(\fI\&$HOME/\s+2.\s0ssh/config\fR), and system-wide configuration file
(\fI/etc/ssh_config\fR).  For each parameter, the first obtained value
will be used.  The configuration files contain sections bracketed by
"Host" specifications, and that section is only applied for hosts that
match one of the patterns given in the specification.  The matched
host name is the one given on the command line.
.LP
Since the first obtained value for each parameter is used, more
host-specific declarations should be given near the beginning of the
file, and general defaults at the end.
.LP
The configuration file has the following format:
.IP
Empty lines and lines starting with '#' are comments.
.IP
Otherwise a line is of the format "keyword arguments".  The possible
keywords and their meanings are as follows (note that the
configuration files are case-sensitive):
.ne 3
.TP
.B Host
Restricts the following declarations (up to the next
.B Host
keyword) to be only for those hosts that match one of the patterns
given after the keyword.  '*' and '?' can be as wildcards in the
patterns.  A single '*' as a pattern can be used to provide global
defaults for all hosts.  The host is the
.IR hostname
argument given on the command line.
.ne 3
.TP
.B UseRsh
Specifies that rlogin/rsh should be used for this host.  It is
possible that the host does not at all support the
.B ssh
protocol.  This causes
.B ssh
to exec 
.B rsh.
All other options (except
.BR HostName )
are ignored if this has been specified.  The argument must be
.de YN
"\fByes\fR" or "\fBno\fR."
..
.YN
.ne 3
.TP
.B FallBackToRsh 
Specifies that if connecting via
.B ssh
fails due to a connection refused error (there is no
.B sshd
listening on the remote host), 
.B rsh
should automatically be used instead (after a suitable warning about
the session being unencrypted).  The argument must be
.YN
.ne 3
.TP
.B HostName
Specifies the real host name to log into.  This can be used to specify
nicnames or abbreviations for hosts.  Default is the name given on the
command line.  Numeric IP addresses are also permitted (both on the
command line and in
.B HostName
specifications).
.ne 3
.TP
.B Port
Specifies the port number to connect on the remote host.  Default is
22.
.ne 3
.TP
.B User
Specifies the user to log in as.  This can be useful if you have a
different user name in different machines.  This saves the trouble of
having to remember to give the user name on the command line.
.ne 3
.TP
.B EscapeChar
Sets the escape character (default: ~).  The escape character can also
be set on the command line.  The argument should be a single
character, '^' followed by a letter, or ``none''.
.ne 3
.TP
.B Cipher
Specifies the cipher to use for encrypting the session.  Currently,
.IR idea ",
.IR des ",
.IR 3des ",
.IR tss ",
and
.I none
are supported.  \fB\s-1IDEA\s0\fR is the default.
.ne 3
.TP
.B RhostsAuthentication
Specifies whether to try rhosts based authentication.  Note that this
declaration only affects the client side and has no effect whatsoever
on security.  Disabling rhosts authentication may reduce
authentication time on slow connections when rhosts authentication is
not used.  Most servers do not support RhostsAuthentication because it
is not secure (see RhostsRSAAuthentication).  The argument to this
keyword must be
.YN
.\" Yes I know it does not make sense, but the full-stop inside quotes
.\" is part of the rules of typography
.ne 3
.TP
.B RhostsRSAAuthentication
Specifies whether to try rhosts based authentication with RSA host
authentication.  The argument must be
.YN
.ne 3
.TP
.B PasswordAuthentication
Specifies whether to use password authentication.  The argument to
this keyword must be
.YN
.ne 3
.TP
.B RSAAuthentication
Specifies whether to use RSA authentication.  The argument to this
keyword must be
.YN
RSA authentication will only be
attempted if the identity file exists, or an authentication agent is
running.
.ne 3
.TP
.B IdentityFile
Specifies the file from which the user's RSA authentication identity
is read (default \fI\s+2.\s0ssh/identity\fR in the user's home directory).
Additionally, any identities represented by the authentication agent
will be used for authentication.  The file name may use the tilde
syntax to refer to a user's home directory.  It is possible to have
multiple identity files specified in configuration files; all these
identities will be tried in sequence.
.ne 3
.TP
.B ForwardAgent
Specifies whether the connection to the authentication agent (if any)
will be forwarded to the remote machine.  The argument must be
.YN
.ne 3
.TP
.B ForwardX11
Specifies whether X11 connections will be automatically redirected
over the secure channel and 
.B \s-1DISPLAY\s0
set.  The argument must be 
.YN
.ne 3
.TP
.B LocalForward
Specifies that a TCP/IP port on the local machine be forwarded over
the secure channel to given host:port from the remote machine.  The
first argument must be a port number, and the second must be
host:port.  Multiple forwardings may be specified, and additional
forwardings can be given on the command line.  Only the root can
forward privileged ports.
.ne 3
.TP
.B RemoteForward
Specifies that a TCP/IP port on the remote machine be forwarded over
the secure channel to given host:port from the local machine.  The
first argument must be a port number, and the second must be
host:port.  Multiple forwardings may be specified, and additional
forwardings can be given on the command line.  Only the root can
forward privileged ports.
.ne 3
.TP
.B GlobalKnownHostsFile
Specifies a file to use instead of /etc/ssh_known_hosts.
.ne 3
.TP
.B UserKnownHostsFile
Specifies a file to use instead of \fI$HOME/\s+2.\s0ssh/known_hosts\fR.

.SH INSTALLATION
.LP
.B Ssh
is normally installed as suid root.  It needs root privileges only for
rhosts authentication (rhosts authentication requires that the
connection must come from a privileged port, and allocating such a
port requires root privileges).  It also needs to be able to read
\fI/etc/ssh_host_key\fR to perform
.B \s-1RSA\s0
host authentication.  It is possible to use
.B ssh
without root privileges, but rhosts authentication will then be
disabled.  
.B Ssh
drops any extra privileges immediately after the connection to the
remote host has been made.

.ne 3
.SH FILES
.TP
.I \&$HOME/\s+2.\s0ssh/known_hosts
Records host keys for all hosts the user has logged into (that are not
in \fI/etc/ssh_known_hosts\fR).  See
.B sshd
manual page.
.ne 3
.TP
.I \&$HOME/\s+2.\s0ssh/random_seed
Used for seeding the random number generator.  This file contains
sensitive data and should not be readable by anyone but the user.
This file is created the first time the program is run and updated
automatically.  The user should never need to read or modify this
file.
.ne 5
.TP
.I \&$HOME/\s+2.\s0ssh/identity
Contains the RSA authentication identity of the user.  This file
contains sensitive data and should not be readable by anyone but the
user.  It is possible to specify a passphrase when generating the key;
the passphrase will be used to encrypt the sensitive part of this file
using 
.BR \s-1IDEA\s0 ".
.ne 3
.TP
.I \&$HOME/\s+2.\s0ssh/identity.pub 
Contains the public key for authentication (public part of the
identity file in human-readable form).  The contents of this file
should be added to \fI$HOME/\s+2.\s0ssh/authorized_keys\fR on all machines
where you wish to log in using RSA authentication.  This file is not
sensitive and can (but need not) be readable by anyone.  This file is
never used automatically and is not necessary; it is only provided for
the convenience of the user.
.ne 3
.TP
.I \&$HOME/\s+2.\s0ssh/config
This is the per-user configuration file.  The format of this file is
described above.  This file is used by the
.B ssh
client.  This file does not usually contain any sensitive information.
.ne 3
.TP
.I \&$HOME/\s+2.\s0ssh/authorized_keys
Lists the RSA keys that can be used for logging in as this user.  The
format of this file is described in the
.B sshd
manual page.  In the simplest form the format is the same as the .pub
identity files (that is, each line contains the number of bits in
modulus, public exponent, modulus, and comment fields, separated by
spaces).
.ne 3
.TP
.I /etc/ssh_known_hosts
Systemwide list of known host keys.  This file should be prepared by the
system administrator to contain the public host keys of all machines in the
organization.  This file should be world-readable.  This file contains
public keys, one per line, in the following format (fields separated
by spaces): system name, number of bits in modulus, public exponent,
modulus, and optional comment field.  When different names are used
for the same machine, all such names should be listed, separated by
commas.  The format is described on the
.B sshd 
manual page.
.IP
The canonical system name (as returned by name servers) is used by
.B sshd
to verify the client host when logging in; other names are needed because
.B ssh
does not convert the user-supplied name to a canonical name before
checking the key, because someone with access to the name servers
would then be able to fool host authentication.
.ne 3
.TP
.I /etc/ssh_config
Systemwide configuration file.  This file provides defaults for those
values that are not specified in the user's configuration file, and
for those users who do not have a configuration file.  This file must
be world-readable.
.ne 3
.TP
.I $HOME/\s+2.\s0rhosts
This file is used in \s+2.\s0rhosts authentication to list the host/user
pairs that are permitted to log in.  (Note that this file is also used
by rlogin and rsh, which makes using this file insecure.)  Each line
of the file contains a host name (in the canonical form returned by
name servers), and then a user name on that host, separated by a
space.  This file may need to be world-readable if the user's home
directory is on a NFS partition, because 
.B sshd 
reads it as root.  Additionally, this file must be owned by the user,
and must not have write permissions for anyone else.
.IP
Note that by default
.B sshd
will be installed so that it requires successful RSA host
authentication before permitting \s+2.\s0rhosts authentication.  If your
server machine does not have the client's host key in
\fI/etc/ssh_known_hosts\fR, you can store it in
\fI$HOME/\s+2.\s0ssh/known_hosts\fR.  The easiest way to do this is to
connect back to the client from the server machine using ssh; this
will automatically add the host key in \fI$HOME/\s+2.\s0ssh/known_hosts\fR.
.ne 3
.TP
.I $HOME/\s+2.\s0shosts
This file is used exactly the same way as \s+2.\s0rhosts.  The purpose for
having this file is to be able to use rhosts authentication with
.B ssh
without permitting login with rlogin or rsh.
.ne 3
.TP
.I /etc/hosts.equiv
This file is used during \s+2.\s0rhosts authentication.  It contains
canonical hosts names, one per line.  If the client host is found in
this file, login is automatically permitted provided client and server
user names are the same.  Additionally, successful RSA host
authentication is normally required.  This file must be readable by root.
